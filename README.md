# Nina
nina is an experimental bot for use on Quixol's discord server. It is a fork of Transcordbot, from the transcord server. 

This is both my first time forking a project on github, as well as making a discord bot, as well as working with javascript/node at all honestly. pls don't judge me too much ;_;
